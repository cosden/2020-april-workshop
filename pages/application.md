Thank you to everyone who expressed interest in attending the original
workshop. Because of the time that has passed since the initial call
for participation and the rescheduled workshop, we will reopen the
call in 2021. Please check back closer to the new workshop date for
information about how to participate in the workshop.

We will strive to accommodate as many as possible, but workshop space
is limited and we are committed to ensuring a broadly diverse
participant group, both in terms of traditional diversity measures as
well as research domain and institutional representation.
