title: Workshop Rescheduled to Fall 2020

The US-RSE Community Building Workshop has been officially rescheduled
for October 27-28, 2020.  It will still be held at the same venue, the
Nassau Inn in Princeton, NJ.

This is a rapidly changing situation and it is impossible to predict
what the travel/conference landscape will look like in October.
Should COVID-19 continue to prevent us from having the workshop in
October, we may need to reschedule for sometime in the following 12 months.
Though we certainly hope it doesnâ€™t come to that.
