title: US-RSE Workshop Postponed due to COVID-19
date: 2020-03-09

After reviewing available options and weighing the risks, the
organizing committee has decided to postpone the US-RSE workshop until
later in 2020.  We do not yet have a date for the workshop, but should
very soon.


This was a difficult decision and not one that we made lightly.  Our
goal is to build and foster an RSE community and in the end, given the
information we have right now, we feel that postponing gives us the
highest likelihood of making this a successful workshop.
